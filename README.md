#  1.) Profile Edit :- 
#  In this task the user will be able to edit his profile.
#  I have written an api to edit the profile of the user with the details given by the user.
#  The validations are also done for the details given by the user(For ex:- The name of the user can not be empty.)
#  I have used MongoDB for this assignment.


#  2.) Reveal and open modes :-
#  In this task I have stored the user's consent of making his profile public or private in the database.
#  I implemented the logic of checking the user has consent to reveal or open another user's profile.


#  3.) Setting up my project and running it :- 
#  Download the zip code from my github repository.
#  Open my project in the vscode.
#  Open a terminal and run the command "cd frontend" followed by "npm i" to download nodemodules and followed by "npm start" to start the frontend of the project.
#  Open another terminal and run the command "cd backend" followed by "npm i express" to install express and followed by "nodemon server.js" to start the backend of the project.


#  4.) Additional libraries used in nodejs are :- 
#  "bcryptjs" to hash the user's password before storing it in the database.
#   Hashed password will be stored in the database.
